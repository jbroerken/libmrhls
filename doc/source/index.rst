The libmrhls library provides a local stream interface for the communication 
between processes. Provided are the functions for creation, sending, receiving 
and closing of communication with similar functions used by both the server and 
client processes.

This documentation includes listings for the internal functions, enumerations, 
etc. used by the library itself. These are not meant to be used directly for 
service development but as information for library development.

As such, this documentation is both aimed at developers wanting to write their 
own user application service as well as library developers wishing to improve 
on the libmrhev source.
