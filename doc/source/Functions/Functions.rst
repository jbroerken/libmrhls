The list of functions shown here includes information about their use case as 
well as the required parameters and return values. Code examples are given if 
deemed neccessary.

Internal functions are used by the library itself. These functions are not 
meant to be used directly for application development.

Function errors can be retrieved by using the get error functions after the 
called function failed.
